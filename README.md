# Edge_detector
We see that image is a two dimensional array of pixels. The task of edge detection is performed using sobel operator. Operating sobel operator on image and collecting the edges in ‘x’ and ‘y’ direction, program calculates the norm i.e. root mean square distance of every pixel of both matrices and define the resulting pixel as edge defining agent.
